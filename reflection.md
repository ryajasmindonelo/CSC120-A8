Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The DetectiveGame class is an interactive mystery-solving game where the user acts as a detective. The user investigates a commotion in their own backyard and can perform various actions such as examinng areas for clues, collecting and using items, and navigating through the environment. The user also has superficial abilities such as shrinking down and growing tall for them to maximize their potential to solve the mystery. Lastly, the class tracks the user's points based on their actions and progress.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
overallPoints method allows the user's overall points to be directly updated;
getoverallPoints method retrieves the user's current points which enables the mystery game to display the user progress;
main(String[] args) is the entry point to the mystery game which provides a sample playthrough to demonstrate how the implemented methods are being used in the mystery game

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I really had tons of fun in this homework because I get to design my own class!!! I would say what worked is that I planned what I wanted to do by jotting down notes. Especially with how I can use the different methods on my own game. Having notes on how I can apply these methods helped me a lot as I was coding. It is an advice I will also give to someone who will take this course in the future. Writing notes for your ideas will help you a lot in the long-run!
